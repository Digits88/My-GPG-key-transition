I am revoking my GPG keys for security & personal issues. 
The old key will continue to be valid for some time,
but I prefer all new correspondance to be encrypted in the new key, and
will be making all signatures going forward with the new key.

This "revoking" document (or transition document if I may say) is signed 
with both keys to validate the transition.

If you have signed my old key, I would appreciate signatures on my new
key as well, provided that your signing policy permits that without
reauthenticating me.

The old key, which I am transitional away from, is:

	pub  4096R/D5E28EE0 (0x192BA1E6D5E28EE0) 2014-02-22 
  	John Ombagi (Linux, DB & Infosec) <ombagi@promaxted.com>
	John Ombagi (Linux, DB & Infosec) <jayombagi@gmail.com>
 	Fingerprint=ACF5 FAFE 3C3D 4CE5 95D9  C31B 192B A1E6 D5E2 8EE0 

The new key, to which I am transitioning, is:

	pub  4096R/AD3A484C (0x7b85a886ad3a484c) 2014-11-10 
	John Ombagi <ombagi@outlook.com>
        John Ombagi (Troon) <jayombagi@gmail.com>
	Fingerprint=CC89 97A6 1F78 304A 7D91  C27F 7B85 A886 AD3A 484C 



To fetch the full new key from a public key server using GnuPG, run:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 0x7B85A886AD3A484C

If you have already validated my old key, you can then validate that the
new key is signed by my old key:

  gpg --check-sigs 0x7B85A886AD3A484C

If you then want to sign my new key, a simple and safe way to do that is
by using caff (shipped in Debian as part of the "signing-party" package)
as follows:

  caff 0x7B85A886AD3A484C


Please contact me via e-mail at <jayombagi@gmail.com> if you have any
questions about this document or this transition.
